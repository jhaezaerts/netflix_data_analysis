"Each year, Spotify shares a summary of your listening behaviour. Something many people happily share on "
"their Instagram stories. _'Look how many hours I spent listening to music! Let's see how many more I can get "
"next year!'_ So why doesn't Netflix share with us such a summary? Can you guess? Maybe it's because for some,"
" a Netflix rewind feels more like an intervention rather than a cool analysis you can show off to your "
"friends. I can imagine sitting through a Netflix rewind and feeling like a lazy, useless piece of garbage by "
"the time it's done. It's not unlikely that a Netflix rewind would reduce watching behaviour rather than "
"increase it. Anyway, this app means to lift the veil on your personal Netflix viewing behaviour. All you need"
" to do is pick a profile. Have fun!"
